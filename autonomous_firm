## A thought by elon Musk
*Talking about his mega-factory: Lots of engeneers work on the car and spend ridiculous amounts of work to improve on the product in order to
gain efficiency/quality improvements and earn around 0.5 to 1%
*It is way more efficient to work on the maschine that builds the maschine (factory) and gain improvements in quality and efficiency around the order of magnitude
of 10-15 percent - that an 10 fold improvement and way more efficient
*the same might be said about law firms:
  * mad amounts of time is spent on drafting contracts and working on them and communication within the firm just in order to make the product just that one percent better than others - or at least comply with the customers wishes
  * This 1% improvement can be easily surpassed by working on the maschine that makes the product.
  * By making that maschine efficient and better working
  * by having predrafted contracts at hand automatically and prefilling the voids 
  * Work on the MSchine that makes the maschine (the firm) rather than just the product
 
 ## Towards the future of a fully autonomous law firm
 * a law firm can basically run on a series of smart contracts that govern a smart entity of the law (jur. person)
  *the entity will act as fully capable jur. person that can:
    *pay its workers according to the contracts
    *earn money
    *give out tasks within the firm
 
 ### Find a task where full information can easily be obtained
  * Good are tasks(Mandate) where the customer just has the problem and the information is publicly available
    *A good example are delayed flights, as the customer just needs to do two things:
      1. Give out mandate (he doesn't need to be smart, can just say help)
      2. Upload its airplane ticket
    *The advantage is, that the information needed is publicly available! The Ticket will be automatically acanned and the flight number 
    and the other details of the flight are detected. That way delay can be read out from the internet and a Beschwerde o.Ã¤. can automatically be drafted
    *Quick exkurs regarding the information: This case is especially good because the customer just needs to upload the ticket which is very easily done with a Phone camera
    The great thing is, that now all the information is online and fully accessible. The worst case would be a szenario where the information would have to be obtained from the customer
    People are rather stupid and don't know the information or even if they do, don't know which information is relevant. E.G. if the customer got into a fight he might have forgotten details
    dont know which details are important and can't really proof the informations provided - hence that is a difficult example
    *Other medium good examples are cases in which information can be very well queried from the customer. For example Mietminderung wg. Heizungsausfall
    In this case the stupid customer must provide the information but it can be easiliy queried: 
      *How many rooms
      *which rooms without heating
      *full heating stop or partially
      *How many days
   *With the information the automatic firm entity can draft automatically a letter/email to the right party
   *No people involved yet
